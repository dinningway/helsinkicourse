# Part 2 Notes

## Synopsis

✏️ How to render a data collection
✏️ How to submit user data to a React app via HTML forms
✏️ How JavaScript code on the frontend can fetch data stored in the backend
✏️ How to add CSS styles to React Applications

When using concatenating things in `console.log` for debugging purposes, seperate with a `comma (,)` and not a `plus (+)`.

## JavaScript Arrays

I will be using functional programming operators such as `find`, `filer`, and `map` all the time.

### Higher Order Functions

✏️ Pros:
Writing code with less code in less time
Composition (taking one function and putting it in another function)
Instead of:

```
function triple (x) {
    return x * 3
}
```

We can do:

```
var triple = function (x) {
    return x * 3
}
```

Functions are values!!
